This is a Python package for the quantitative analysis of the interaction of
energetic x-rays with matter. This package is named after one of the
discoverers of X-rays, `Wilhelm Roentgen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_RÃ¶ntgen>`.
He awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the
extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable
rays subsequently named after him". X-rays were originally referred to as Roentgen rays.

This might include the generation process of x-rays from emission lines
to the penetration or absorption of x-rays in materials. These materials may be
metals, gases, biological, or detector materials.

This package is in active development and provides the following capabilities.

A working version of a GUI can that enables calculation of the emission and absorption of x-rays be found installed on `heroku <https://roentgen-gui.herokuapp.com/gui>`_.
